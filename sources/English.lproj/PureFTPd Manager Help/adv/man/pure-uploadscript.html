   <H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
    pure-uploadscript  - Automatically run an external program after a suc-
       cessful upload.     

</PRE>
    <H2>SYNTAX</H2><PRE>
       pure-uploadscript [<I>-p</I> &lt;<I>/path/to/pidfile</I>&gt;] [<I>-B</I>] [<I>-g</I> &lt;<I>gid</I>&gt;] [<I>-h</I>] <I>-r</I> &lt;<I>pro-</I>
       <I>gram</I> <I>to</I> <I>run</I>&gt; [<I>-u</I> &lt;<I>uid</I>&gt;]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       If  Pure-FTPd  is  compiled with <B>--with-uploadscript</B> (default in binary
       distributions), and if the <B>-o</B> (or  <B>--uploadscript</B>)  is  passed  to  the
       server,  a named pipe called <B>/var/run/pure-ftpd.upload.pipe</B> is created.
       You    will    also     notice     an     important     file     called
       <B>/var/run/pure-ftpd.upload.lock</B>, used for locking.
       After a successful upload, the file name is written to the pipe.
       <B>pure-uploadscript</B>  reads  this pipe to automatically run any program or
       script to process the newly uploaded file.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-B</B>     Daemonize the process and fork it in background.

       <B>-g</B> &lt;<I>gid</I>&gt;
              Switch the group ID to &lt;<I>gid</I>&gt;.

       <B>-h</B> or <B>--help</B>
              Display available options.

       <B>-r</B> &lt;<I>program</I> <I>to</I> <I>run</I>&gt;
              Tell what program/script to run. It has to be <I>an</I> <I>absolute</I>  <I>file-</I>
              <I>name</I>, the <B>PATH</B> environment variable is ignored.  The first argu-
              ment of that program will be the  <I>unquoted</I>  name  of  the  newly
              uploaded  file.   Environment variables aren't cleared. So don't
              put sensitive data in them before calling  pure-uploadscript  if
              you switch uid.

       <B>-u</B> &lt;<I>uid</I>&gt;
              Switch the user ID to &lt;<I>uid</I>&gt;.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       When  the  upload script is run, the name of the newly uploaded file is
       the first argument passed to the  script  (referenced  as  $1  by  most
       shells)  .  Some  environment  variables are also filled by useful info
       about  the  file.   <B>UPLOAD_SIZE</B>  The  size  of  the  file,  in   bytes.
       <B>UPLOAD_PERMS</B>  The  permissions,  as  an  octal integer.  <B>UPLOAD_UID</B> The
       numerical UID of the owner.  <B>UPLOAD_GID</B> The numerical GID of the owner.
       <B>UPLOAD_USER</B>  The  login  of the owner.  <B>UPLOAD_GROUP</B> The group name the
       files belongs to.  <B>UPLOAD_VUSER</B> The full user name, or the virtual user
       name (127 chars max) .


</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       <I>/var/run/pure-ftpd.upload.pipe</I>           <I>/var/run/pure-ftpd.upload.lock</I>
       <I>/var/run/pure-uploadscript.pid</I>

<H2>SECURITY</H2><PRE>
       <B>pure-ftpd</B> and <B>pure-uploadscript</B> are trying to limit  security  implica-
       pipe.

       -  Only  regular  files are processed, control characters are rejected,
       and a header+footer avoid partial file names.

       - Two external programs/scripts can't run at the same time. Uploads are
       always processed sequentially, in chronological order. This is to avoid
       denial-of-services  by  issuing  a lot of simultaneous STOR commands in
       order to launch a fork bomb on the server. For this reason,  your  pro-
       grams  shouldn't  take  a long time to complete (but they can run them-
       selves in background) .


       <B>EXAMPLES</B>

       A sample script could be :

       #! /bin/sh
       echo  "$1  uploaded"  |  /usr/bin/mutt  -s  "New  upload : $1" \ ftpad-
       min@dom.ai.n

       Never forget to quote (<B>"variable"</B>) all  variables  in  all  your  shell
       scripts to avoid security flaws.
