<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>Pure-FTPd</B> is a small, simple server for the old and hairy File Transfer
       Protocol, designed to use less resources than older servers, be smaller
       and very secure, and to never execute any external program.

       It  support most-used features and commands of FTP (including many mod-
       ern extensions), and leaves out everything which is  deprecated,  mean-
       ingless, insecure, or correlates with trouble.

       IPv6 is fully supported.



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-0</B>     When  a file is uploaded and there is already a previous version
              of the file with the same name, the old file  will  neither  get
              removed  nor  truncated.   Upload will take place in a temporary
              file and once the upload is complete, the switch to the new ver-
              sion  will  be  atomic.  This option should not be used together
              with virtual quotas.

       <B>-1</B>     Add the PID to the syslog output. Ignored if <B>-f</B> <B>none</B> is set.

       <B>-4</B>     Listen only to IPv4 connections.

       <B>-6</B>     Listen only to IPv6 connections.

       <B>-a</B> <B>gid</B> Regular users will be chrooted to their home directories, unless
              they  belong  to  the  specified  gid.  Note that root is always
              trusted, and that chroot() occurs only for anonymous ftp without
              this option.

       <B>-A</B>     Chroot() everyone, but root.

       <B>-b</B>     Be broken. Turns on some compatibility hacks for shoddy clients,
              and for broken Netfilter gateways.

       <B>-B</B>     Start the standalone server in background (daemonize).

       <B>-c</B> <B>clients</B>
              Allow a maximum of <I>clients</I> to be connected.  <I>clients</I> must be  at
              least 1, and if you combine it with <B>-p</B> it will be forced down to
              half the number of ports specified by <B>-p.</B>  If more than  <I>clients</I>
              are  connected,  new  clients are rejected at once, even clients
              wishing to upload, or to log in as normal users.  Therefore,  it
              is  advisable  to  use  <B>-m</B>  as  primary overload protection. The
              default value is 50.

       <B>-d</B>     turns on debug logging. Every command is logged, except that the
              argument  to PASS is changed to "&lt;password&gt;". If you repeat <B>-d</B> ,
              responses too are logged.

       <B>-e</B>     Only allow anonymous users to log in.

       <B>-E</B>     Only allow authenticated login. Anonymous users are  prohibited.

       <B>-f</B> <B>facility</B>
              makes  ftpd  use  <I>facility</I> for all <B>syslog(3)</B> messages.  <I>facility</I>
              defaults to <B>ftp</B>.  The facility  names  are  normally  listed  in
              <I>/usr/include/sys/syslog.h</I>.   Note  that  if  <B>-f</B> is not the first
              option on the command line, a couple of messages may  be  logged
              to  local2  before the <B>-f</B> option is parsed.  Use <B>-f</B> <B>none</B> to dis-
              able logging.

       <B>-F</B> <B>fortunes</B> <B>file</B>
              Display a funny random message in the initial login banner.  The
              random  cookies  are extracted from a text file, in the standard
              <B>fortune</B> format. If you installed the <B>fortune</B> package, you should
              have a directory (usually <B>/usr/share/fortune</B> ) with binary files
              ( <B>xxxx.dat</B> ) and text files (without the <B>.dat</B> extension).

       <B>-g</B> <B>pidfile</B>
              In standalone mode, write the pid to that  file  in  instead  of
              /var/run/pure-ftpd.pid .

       <B>-G</B>     When  this option is enabled, people can no more change the name
              of already uploaded files, even if they own those files or their
              directory.

       <B>-H</B>     Don't  resolve host names ("192.0.34.166" will be logged instead
              of "www.example.com"). It can significantly speed up connections
              and reduce bandwidth usage on busy servers. Use it especially on
              public FTP sites.

       <B>-i</B>     Disallow upload for anonymous users, whatever directory  permis-
              sions are. This option is especially useful for virtual hosting,
              to avoid your users create warez sites in their account.

       <B>-I</B> <B>timeout</B>
              Change the maximum idle time. The timeout  is  in  minutes,  and
              defaults to 15.

       <B>-j</B>     If  the  home  directory of an user doesn't exist, automatically
              create it. The newly created home directory belongs to the user,
              and permissions are set according to the current directory mask.
              To avoid local attacks, the parent directory should never belong
              to an untrusted user.

       <B>-k</B> <B>percentage</B>
              Disallow  upload  if the partition is more than <B>percentage</B> full.
              Different authentication methods  can  be  mixed  together.  For
              instance  if  you  run  the  server  with  <I>-lpuredb:/etc/pwd.pdb</I>
              <I>-lmysql:/etc/my.cf</I> <I>-lunix</I> Accounts will first  be  authenticated
              from  a  PureDB  database.  If  it fails, a MySQL server will be
              asked. If the account is still not found is the database,  stan-
              dard  unix  accounts will be scanned. Authentication methods are
              tried in the order you give the -l options.
              See the <I>README.LDAP</I> and <I>README.MySQL</I> files for  info  about  the
              built-in LDAP and SQL directory support.

       <B>-L</B> <B>max</B> <B>files:max</B> <B>depth</B>
              Avoid  denial-of-service  attacks by limiting the number of dis-
              played files in a 'ls' and the  maximum  depth  of  a  recursive
              'ls'.  Defaults  are  2000:5  (2000 files displayed for a single
              'ls' and walk through 5 subdirectories max).

       <B>-m</B> <B>load</B>
              Do not allow anonymous users to download files if  the  load  is
              above <I>load</I> when the user connects. Uploads and file listings are
              still allowed, as are downloads by real users. The user  is  not
              told about this until he/she tries to download a file.

       <B>-M</B>     Allow anonymous users to create directories.

       <B>-n</B> <B>maxfiles:maxsize</B>
              Enable <B>virtual</B> <B>quotas</B> When virtual quotas are enabled, .ftpquota
              files are created, and the  number  of  files  for  an  user  is
              restricted to 'maxfiles'. The max total size of his directory is
              also restricted to 'maxsize' Megabytes. Members of  the  trusted
              group aren't subject to quotas.

       <B>-N</B>     NAT  mode. Force <B>active</B> mode. If your FTP server is behind a NAT
              box that doesn't support applicative FTP proxying, or if you use
              port  redirection  without  a  transparent  FTP proxy, use this.
              Well... the previous sentence isn't very clear.  Okay:  if  your
              network looks like this:
              FTP--NAT.gateway/router--Internet
              and  if  you want people coming from the internet to have access
              to your FTP server, please try without  this  option  first.  If
              Netscape clients can connect without any problem, your NAT gate-
              way rulez. If Netscape doesn't display directory listings,  your
              NAT gateway sucks. Use <B>-N</B> as a workaround.

       <B>-o</B>     Enable <I>pure-uploadscript</I>.

       <B>-O</B> <B>format:log</B> <B>file</B>
              Record all file transfers into a specific log file, in an alter-
              native format. Currently, three formats  are  supported  :  CLF,
              Stats, W3C and xferlog.
              If you add
              <B>-O</B> <B>clf:/var/log/pureftpd.log</B>
              to  your  starting  options,  Pure-FTPd  will  log  transfers in
              Use only ports in the range <I>first</I> to  <I>last</I>  inclusive  for  pas-
              sive-mode  downloads.  This  means  that clients will not try to
              open connections to TCP ports outside the range  <I>first</I>  <I>-</I>  <I>last</I>,
              which  makes pure-ftpd more compatible with packet filters. Note
              that the maximum number of clients (specified with <B>-c</B>) is forced
              down  to  <I>(last</I>  <I>+</I> <I>1</I> <I>-</I> <I>first)/2</I> if it is greater, as the default
              is. (The syntax for the port range is, conveniently, the same as
              that of <B>iptables).</B>

       <B>-P</B> <B>ip</B> <B>address</B> <B>or</B> <B>host</B> <B>name</B>
              Force the specified IP address in reply to a <B>PASV/EPSV/SPSV</B> com-
              mand. If the server is behind  a  masquerading  (NAT)  box  that
              doesn't  properly  handle  stateful FTP masquerading, put the ip
              address of that box here. If you have a dynamic IP address,  you
              can use a symbolic host name (probably the one of your gateway),
              that will be resolved every time a new client will connect.

       <B>-q</B> <B>upload:download</B>
              Enable an upload/download ratio for anonymous users (ex: <I>-q</I>  <I>1:5</I>
              means that 1 Mb of goodies have to be uploaded to leech 5 Mb).

       <B>-Q</B> <B>upload:download</B>
              Enable  ratios  for anonymous and non-anonymous users. If the <I>-a</I>
              option is also used, users from the trusted group have no ratio.

       <B>-r</B>     Never  overwrite  existing  files.  Uploading a file whoose name
              already exists cause  an  automatic  rename.  Files  are  called
              xyz.1, xyz.2, xyz.3, etc.

       <B>-R</B>     Disallow users (even non-anonymous ones) usage of the CHMOD com-
              mand. On hosting services, it may  prevent  newbies  from  doing
              mistakes,  like setting bad permissions on their home directory.
              Only root can use CHMOD when this switch is enabled.

       <B>-s</B>     Don't allow anonymous users to retrieve  files  owned  by  "ftp"
              (generally, files uploaded by other anonymous users).

       <B>-S</B> <B>[{ip</B> <B>address|hostname}]</B> <B>[,{port|service</B> <B>name}]</B>
              This  option  is only effective when the server is launched as a
              standalone server.  Connections are accepted on the specified IP
              and  port. IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. Numeric and fully-quali-
              fied host names are accepted. A service name (see /etc/services)
              can be used instead of a numeric port number.

       <B>-t</B> <B>bandwidth</B>
              or  <B>-t</B> <B>upload</B> <B>bandwidth:download</B> <B>bandwidth</B> Enable process prior-
              ity lowering and bandwidth throttling for anonymous users. Delay
              should be in kilobytes/seconds.

       <B>-T</B> <B>bandwidth</B>
              or  <B>-T</B> <B>upload</B> <B>bandwidth:download</B> <B>bandwidth</B> Enable process prior-
              ity  lowering  and  bandwidth  throttling   for   *ALL*   users.
              than <I>uid</I>.  <B>-u</B> <B>1</B> denies access only to root accounts. The default
              is to allow FTP access to all accounts.

       <B>-U</B> <B>umask</B> <B>files:umask</B> <B>dirs</B>
              Change the mask for creation of new files and  directories.  The
              default  are 133 (files are readable -but not writable- by other
              users) and 022 (same thing for directory, with the  execute  bit
              on).   If  new  files  should  only be readable by the user, use
              177:077. If you  want  uploaded  files  to  be  executable,  use
              022:022  (files  will  be  readable  by other people) or 077:077
              (files will only be readable by their owner).

       <B>-v</B> <B>bonjour</B> <B>name</B>
              Set the Bonjour name of the service (only available on  MacOS  X
              when Bonjour support is compiled in).

       <B>-V</B> <B>ip</B> <B>address</B>
              Allow  non-anonymous  FTP  access only on this specific local IP
              address. All other IP addresses are only  anonymous.  With  that
              option,  you  can have routed IPs for public access, and a local
              IP (like 10.x.x.x) for  administration.  You  can  also  have  a
              routable  trusted  IP protected by firewall rules, and only that
              IP can be used to login as a non-anonymous user.

       <B>-w</B>     Enable support for the FXP  protocol,  for  non-anonymous  users
              only.

       <B>-W</B>     Enable the FXP protocol for everyone.  <I>FXP</I> <I>IS</I> <I>AN</I> <I>UNSECURE</I> <I>PROTO-</I>
              <I>COL.</I> <I>NEVER</I> <I>ENABLE</I> <I>IT</I> <I>ON</I> <I>UNTRUSTED</I> <I>NETWORKS.</I>

       <B>-x</B>     In normal operation mode,  authenticated  users  can  read/write
              files  beginning  with  a  dot ('.'). Anonymous users can't, for
              security reasons (like changing banners or a forgotten .rhosts).
              When  '-x'  is used, authenticated users can download dot-files,
              but not overwrite/create them, even if they own them. That  way,
              you can prevent hosted users from messing

       <B>-X</B>     This flag is identical to the previous one (writing dot-files is
              prohibited), but in addition, users can't even *read* files  and
              directories beginning with a dot (like "cd .ssh").

       <B>-y</B> <B>per</B> <B>user</B> <B>max</B> <B>sessions:max</B> <B>anonymous</B> <B>sessions</B>
              This  switch enables per-user concurrency limits. Two values are
              separated by a column. The first one is the max number  of  con-
              current sessions for a single login. The second one is the maxi-
              mum number of anonoymous sessions.

       This  version of pure-ftpd can use PAM for authentication. If you wan't
       it to consult any files like /etc/shells or /etc/ftpd/ftpusers  consult
       pam docs. LDAP directories and SQL databases are also supported.

       Anonymous users are authenticated in any of three ways:

       1.  The  user  logs  in as "ftp" or "anonymous" and there is an account
       called "ftp" with an existing home directory. This server does not  ask
       anonymous users for an email address or other password.

       2.  The  user connects to an IP address which resolves to the name of a
       directory in <I>/etc/pure-ftpd</I> (or a symlink in that directory to  a  real
       directory),  and  there is an account called "ftp" (which does not need
       to have a valid home directory). See <B>Virtual</B> <B>Servers</B> below.

       <B>Ftpd</B> does a <B>chroot(2)</B> to the relevant base directory when an  anonymous
       user logs in.

       Note that <B>ftpd</B> allows remote users to log in as root if the password is
       known and -u not used.



</PRE>
<H2>UNUSUAL FEATURES</H2><PRE>
       <B>Ftpd</B> never switches uid and euid, it uses <B>setfsuid(2)</B> instead. The main
       reason  is  that  uid switching has been exploited in several breakins,
       but the sheer ugliness of uid switching counts too.   <B>Ftpd</B>  only  calls
       <B>setfsuid(2)</B> once, at login.

       If a user's home directory is <B>/path/to/home/./</B>, FTP sessions under that
       UID will be chroot()ed. In addition, if a  users's  home  directory  is
       <B>/path/to/home/./directory</B>   the   session   will   be   chroot()ed   to
       /path/to/home and the FTP session will start in 'directory'.

       As noted above, this <B>pure-ftpd</B> omits several features that are required
       by  the  RFC  or might be considered useful at first. Here is a list of
       the most important omissions.

       On-the-fly tar is not supported, for several reasons. I feel that users
       who  want  to  get  many  files should use a special FTP client such as
       "mirror," which also supports incremental fetch. I don't want to either
       add  several  hundred  lines  of code to create tar files or execute an
       external tar. Finally, on-the-fly tar distorts log files.

       On-the-fly compression is left out too. Most files on an FTP  site  are
       compressed  already,  and if a file isn't, there presumably is a reason
       why. (As for decompression: Don't  FTP  users  waste  bandwidth  enough
       without help from on-the-fly decompression?)



</PRE>
<H2>DIRECTORY ALIASES</H2><PRE>
       Shortcuts  for  the  "cd"  command can be set up if the server has been
       compiled with the --with-diraliases feature.
       tories  writable  by  "ftp." It is probably best if all directories are
       writable only by a special group such as "ftpadmin" and "ftp" is not  a
       member of this group.

       If  you do not trust the local users, put <I>~ftp</I> on a separate partition,
       so local users can't hard-link unapproved files into the anonymous  FTP
       area.

       Use of the <B>-s</B> option is strongly suggested. (Simply add "-s" to the end
       of the <B>ftpd</B> line in <I>/etc/inetd.conf</I> to enable it.)

       Most other  FTP  servers  require  that  a  number  of  files  such  as
       <I>~ftp/bin/ls</I>  exist.  This  server  does  not  require that any files or
       directories within <I>~/ftp</I> whatsoever exist, and  I  recommend  that  all
       such unnecessary files are removed (for no real reason).

       It  may be worth considering to run the anonymous FTP service as a vir-
       tual server, to get automatic  logins  and  to  firewall  off  the  FTP
       address/port to which real users can log in.

       If  your  server is a public FTP site, you may want to allow only 'ftp'
       and 'anonymous' users to log in. Use  the  <B>-e</B>  option  for  this.  Real
       accounts  will be ignored and you will get a secure, anonymous-only FTP
       server.



</PRE>
<H2>MAGIC FILES</H2><PRE>
       The files <I>&lt;ftproot&gt;/.banner</I> and <I>.message</I> are magical.

       If there is a file called <I>.banner</I> in the root directory of  the  anony-
       mous  FTP  area,  or in the root directory of a virtual host, and it is
       shorter than 1024 bytes, it is printed upon login. (If the client  does
       not  log  in explicitly, and an implicit login is triggered by a CWD or
       CDUP command, the banner is not printed. This is regrettable  but  hard
       to avoid.)

       If  there  is a file called <I>.message</I> in any directory and it is shorter
       than 1024 bytes, that file is  printed  whenever  a  user  enters  that
       directory using CWD or CDUP.



</PRE>
<H2>VIRTUAL SERVERS</H2><PRE>
       You  can  run  several  different anonymous FTP servers on one host, by
       giving the host several IP addresses with different DNS names.

       Here are the steps needed to create an extra server using an  IP  alias
       on linux 2.4.x, called "ftp.example.com" on address 10.11.12.13. on the
       IP alias eth0.

       1. Create an "ftp" account if you do not have one. It it  best  if  the
       account  does  not  have  a valid home directory and shell. I prefer to
       make <I>/dev/null</I> the ftp account's home directory and shell.   <B>Ftpd</B>  uses
       localhost". If that doesn't log you in, the problem is with <B>ftpd.</B>

       If not, "ping -v 10.11.12.13" and/or "ping -v ftp.example.com" from the
       same host. If this does not work, the problem is with the IP alias.

       Next,  try "ping -v 10.11.12.13" from a host on the local ethernet, and
       afterwards "/sbin/arp -a". If  10.11.12.13  is  listed  among  the  ARP
       entries with the correct hardware address, the problem is probably with
       the IP alias. If  10.11.12.13  is  listed,  but  has  hardware  address
       0:0:0:0:0:0, then proxy-ARP isn't working.

       If none of that helps, I'm stumped. Good luck.

       <B>Warning:</B> If you setup a virtual hosts, normal users will not be able to
       login via this name, so <B>don't</B> create link/directory  in  <I>/etc/pure-ftpd</I>
       for your regular hostname.



</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       <I>/etc/passwd</I> is used via libc (and PAM is this case), to get the uid and
       home directory of normal users, the uid and home directory of "ftp" for
       normal  anonymous ftp, and just the uid of "ftp" for virtual ftp hosts.

       <I>/etc/shadow</I> is used like <I>/etc/passwd</I> if shadow support is enabled.

       <I>/etc/group</I> is used via libc, to get  the  group  membership  of  normal
       users.

       <I>/proc/net/tcp</I>  is  used to count existing FTP connections, if the <B>-c</B> or
       <B>-p</B> options are used

       <I>/etc/pure-ftpd/&lt;ip</I> <I>address&gt;</I> is the base directory for the &lt;ip  address&gt;
       virtual  ftp  server,  or  a symbolic link to its base directory.  <B>Ftpd</B>
       does a <B>chroot(2)</B> into this  directory  when  a  user  logs  in  to  &lt;ip
       address&gt;, thus symlinks outside this directory will not work.

       <I>~ftp</I>  is  the  base  directory for "normal" anonymous FTP.  <B>Ftpd</B> does a
       <B>chroot(2)</B> into this directory when an anonymous user logs in, thus sym-
       links outside this directory will not work.



</PRE>
<H2>LS</H2><PRE>
       The  behaviour  of  LIST  and  NLST is a tricky issue. Few servers send
       RFC-compliant responses to LIST, and some clients depend on non-compli-
       ant responses.

       This server uses <B>glob(3)</B> to do filename globbing.

       The  response  to NLST is by default similar to that of <B>ls(1)</B>, and that
       to LIST is by default similar to that of <B>ls</B> <B>-l</B> or <B>ls</B> <B>-lg</B> on  most  Unix
       systems,  except  that  the "total" count is meaningless.  Only regular
       files, directories and symlinks are shown. Only  important  <B>ls</B>  options
       <B>-F</B>     appends '*' to executable regular files, '@' to symlinks and '/'
              to directories.

       <B>-l</B>     shows various details about the file, including file group.  See
              <B>ls(1)</B> for details. Undoes <B>-1</B> and <B>-C</B>.

       <B>-r</B>     reverses  the  sorting order (modifies <B>-S</B> and <B>-t</B> and the default
              alphabetical ordering).

       <B>-R</B>     recursively descends into subdirectories of the argument  direc-
              tories.

       <B>-S</B>     Sorts by file size instead of by name. Undoes <B>-t</B>.

       <B>-t</B>     Sorts by file modification time instead of by name. Undoes <B>-S</B>.
