*** IF YOU ARE RUNNING A RECENT LINUX KERNEL (2.4.3ac14, 2.4.4 and ***
*** later) FOR FIREWALL/MASQUERADING , YOU DON'T NEED TO READ THIS ***
*** DOCUMENT. ALSO, BSD SYSTEMS RUNNING IPFILTER AREN'T CONCERNED. ***


  Linux kernel 2.4 has a nice built-in NAT/firewalling code called
Netfilter. This new code supports connection tracking ('stateful firewall')
and is easily extensible.

  But the FTP protocol itself has always been a nightmare for firewalls
designers. Because the protocol isn't complex, but... well... strange! So
that it requires a special handler (especially for the 'passive mode') .

  Linux kernel earlier than 2.4.4 (or 2.4.3ac14) have a partial support of
the FTP protocol. 

  If you are trying to firewall or masquerade a Pure-FTPd server, passive
connections won't work with some modern clients like lftp. Commands like
'ls' will freeze your client and finally close the connection.

  This is *NOT* a bug in Pure-FTPd, but a problem in Netfilter. Old versions
of Netfilter only know a very limited subset of the FTP protocol. They don't
know about EPSV and EPRT commands, implemented in modern FTP clients and
servers. These commands superscede PASV and PORT and are IPv6 capable.

  Pure-FTPd is not the only server that doesn't work with older Netfilter
code. *ALL* recent BSD servers (current OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD) are also
affected. Of course you have to use a EPSV/EPRT aware client to trigger the
bug. SuSE Linux comes with NetBSD 'ftp' client that supports these commands.

  Also, old linux kernels have a serious security flaw in their FTP
connection tracking code. Basically, an external user can open any filtered
port if the FTP connection tracking code is enabled.

  So, if you are using Linux firewalls/masquerading boxes, please upgrade
their kernel as soon as possible, to the latest 2.4 release. Even 2.4.4
kernels are rather old and they also have known bugs and vulnerabilities.
  It's why upgrading is definitely something to do. And EPSV/EPRT will work.
